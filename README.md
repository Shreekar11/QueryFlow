> Execute your Queries with ease

## Project Overview

QueryFlow is an application that allows users to write, execute, and manage SQL queries with a focus on usability, performance, and advanced functionality. Core features include a SQL query editor for executing queries, a dropdown for selecting predefined queries, and a table for displaying data. Additional features include query history, searchable query history, CSV export, virtualization to render large datasets, sorting data functionality, and dark mode to enhance the user experience. The project showcases various functionalities, performance optimizations, and a user-focused layout design.

## Features

### Core Features
- **SQL Query Editor**: Write SQL queries using `AceEditor` with MySQL syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and theme support.
- **Dropdown Predefined Query Selector**: Select and execute predefined queries from a dropdown list.
- **Table to Display Data**: View query results in a responsive table.

### Additional Features
- **Query History**: Access the last 5 executed queries from the history list.
- **Search Query History**: Quickly find previously executed queries using a search function within the history list.
- **CSV Export**: Export query results as a CSV file.
- **Optimized Table Rendering for Large Datasets**: Efficiently render large datasets using `react-window` without impacting browser performance.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort table data in ascending or descending order by clicking on the table headers.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for enhanced accessibility.

## Tech Stack

### Framework and Language
- **React.js** â€“ JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€“ Superset of JavaScript for type safety.

### Major Plugins and Packages
- **UI & Styling**
  - `"@mui/material": "^6.4.8"` â€“ Responsive, theme-aware UI components.
  - `"@mui/icons-material": "^6.4.8"` â€“ Material UI icons.
- **Tables & Large Data Handling**
  - `"react-window": "^1.8.11"` â€“ Optimized rendering for large datasets.
  - `"react-table": "^7.8.0"` â€“ Lightweight, flexible table library.
- **Query Editor & Syntax Highlighting**
  - `"react-ace": "^14.0.1"` â€“ SQL query editor with syntax highlighting.
- **Data Export**
  - `"papaparse": "^5.5.2"` â€“ CSV export functionality.
- **Notifications**
  - `"sonner": "^2.0.2"` â€“ For toast notifications.

## Page Load Time

![Performance Diagram](screenshots/performance.png)

- **Measurement**: The page load time was measured using Chrome DevTools' **Lighthouse** tool
- **Result**: The page load time is approximately **0.4 seconds** to **1.0 seconds**.
- **How It Was Measured**:
  - Opened Chrome DevTools, navigated to the Lighthouse tab, and ran a performance audit with the following settings:
  - Recorded the TTI metric from the Lighthouse report.

## Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations were applied to decrease load time and increase overall performance:

- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy-loaded components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, reducing the initial bundle size.
- **Suspense Fallbacks**: Added loading states for lazy-loaded components to enhance user experience.
- **`useCallback` & `useMemo` Hooks**:  
  - **`useCallback`**: Used to memoize functions, preventing unnecessary re-creations on re-renders and improving performance in event handlers and callbacks.  
  - **`useMemo`**: Memoizes expensive calculations, ensuring they are only recomputed when dependencies change, reducing redundant computations.
- **Component Splitting**: Split code into smaller components to minimize re-renders and improve responsiveness.
- **Static Styles in CSS**: Moved static styles to `App.css`, reducing First Contentful Paint (FCP).

## Pros and Cons of Proposed Solution

### Pros

- Includes core features like a query editor, selector, and table, along with advanced features such as history, searchable query history and CSV export.
- Data table efficiently handles ~1,000 rows using react-window.
- Supports sorting functionality, allowing users to sort table data in ascending or descending order by clicking on column headers.
- AceEditor, dark mode, and a responsive design enhance usability.
- TypeScript, a modular structure, and JSDoc comments improve maintainability.

### Cons

- Currently supports basic SELECT \* FROM table queries.
- Uses mock data instead of a retrieving from backend server.

## Solution Future Aspects

- Add more robust query validation (e.g., using a SQL parser).
- Replace mock data with actual backend server to execute queries against a database.
